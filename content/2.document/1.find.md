Provides two ways to find documents in a collection depending on the query
input type.

- [`JSON`](#_1-using-json-filter)
- [`key-value pairs`](#_2-key-value-pairs)

Both methods use the same underlying function to find documents
hence editing one leads to changing the other. At all times, the JSON filter
matches the key-value pairs.

### 1. Using JSON filter

---

You can pass a `JSON` value as filter as is inJavaScript.

In Javascript:

```javascript [JavaScript]
db.collection('collection_name').find({name: "One"})
// OR
db.collection('collection_name').find({name: {"$eq": "One"}})
```

In MongoUI:

```json ['JSON MongoUI']
{
  "name": "One"
}
// OR
{
  "name": {"$eq": "One"}
}
```

### 2. key-value pairs

---

Key-value pairs are an alternative to the JSON values.
They provide an easy and intuitive way for creating queries.
The key-value pairs are ultimately parsed into JSON values before being
passed to the find commands.

Query operators are also provided alongside the key and value in order to
parse the query appropriately.
The query operators are matched to simpler symbols which makes it is easier to
write complex queries without knowing the operators names as they are in mongodb.

> For now only comparison operators listed below are supported. Other operators will be added soon.

| MongoDb Operator | MongoUI key-value operator |
|:--------------:|:------------------------:|
| $eq | `=` |
| $ne | `!=` |
| $lt | `<` |
| $lte | `<=` |
| $gt | `>` |
| $gte | `>=` |
| $in | `[]` / `[ ]` |
| $nin | `![]` / `![ ]` |

> :pen: NOTE: If the operator is not provided, `=` that maps to `"$eq"` is assumed.

##### Examples

1. **String** and **number** values

| Key | Operator | Value |
|:-----:|:------:|:-----------:|
| name | = | One |
| age | < | 10 |
| place | *missing operator* | Here |

Resulting JSON:

```json ['JSON MongoUI']
{
  "name": {
    "$eq": "One"
  },
  "age": {
    "$lt": 10
  },
  "place": {
    "$eq": "Here" // $eq is assumed if missing operator.
  }
}
```

2. **Array** value

| Key | Operator | Value |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| name | `[ ]` | `[ One, Two ]` |
| age | `![ ]` | `[ 10, 21, 32 ]` |
| place | = | `[ Here ]` |

Resulting JSON:

```json ['JSON MongoUI']
{
  "name": {
    "$in": [ "One", "Two" ]
  },
  "age": {
    "$nin": [ 10, 21, 32 ]
  },
  "place": {
    "$eq": [ "Here" ]
  }
}
```

3. If a key appears more than once, all the values are parsed under one key
in the resulting JSON.

| Key | Operator | Value |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| name | `![ ]` | `[ One ]` |
| name | `[ ]` | `[ Two, Three ]` |

Resulting JSON:

```json ['JSON MongoUI']
{
  // Single key with both operators
  "name": {
    "$nin": [ "One" ],
    "$in": [ "Two", "Three" ]
  },
}
```

4. If a key appears more than once with the same operator, only the last value is
applied for that operator in the resulting JSON.

 Key | Operator | Value |
|:-----:|:------:|:------:|
| name | = | One |
| name | = | Two |

Resulting JSON:

```json ['JSON MongoUI']
{
  "name": {
    "$eq": "Two", // Last to be defined.
  },
}
```

5. You can uncheck a key-value pair to ensure it's not included in the filter
when querying the database.

| Checkbox | Key | Operator | Value |
|:----------:|:-----:|:------:|:-----------:|
| &check; | name | `[ ]` | `[ One, Two ]` |
| &check; | age | `![ ]` | `[ 10, 21, 32 ]` |
| &cross; *Not checked* | place | = | `[ Here ]` |

Resulting JSON:

```json ['JSON MongoUI']
{
  "name": {
    "$in": [ "One", "Two" ]
  },
  "age": {
    "$nin": [ 10, 21, 32 ]
  }
  // place is not included.
}
```
