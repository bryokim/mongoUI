A `filter` that defines deletion criteria is expected.

```json ['filter']
{
  "name": "One",
  "age": { "$eq": 23 }
}
```

By default, the `deleteOne` method is used. If you want to use `deleteMany`, you need to check the deleteMany checkbox below the filter.

Optional settings to the delete commands can be passed by filling the `Options`.
